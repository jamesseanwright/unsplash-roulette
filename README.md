Xbox One-compatible UWP app that displays random photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), backed by random Kevin MacLeod music. Follows the MVVM design pattern.


## Running on Xbox One

See the [guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/getting-started) on MSDN to set up the development environment. I'm going to write a blog post about this, but just a heads-up; you can use the Community Edition of Visual Studio if you don't have a license.


## Music

The app randomly selects and plays one of the following [Kevin MacLeod](https://incompetech.com/) songs:

* Sapphire Island
* Dream Culture
* Dreams Become Real
* Moonstone
* Winter Chimes
